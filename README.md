You should add some more to this document! Here's a song to get you started:

Where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness; Where the Tigers play; Here the sons of dear Old Clemson, Reign supreme alway.

We will dream of great conquests For our past is grand, And her sons have fought and conquered Every foreign land.

Where the mountains smile in grandeur Oâ€™er the hill and dale; Here the Tiger lair is nestling Swept by storm and gale.

We are brothers strong in manhood For we work and strive; and our Alma Mater reigneth Forever in our lives.
